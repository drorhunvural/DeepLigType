**Requirements**

<br/> To run the program, you'll need an operating system with a Linux kernel. Please note that certain libraries, such as libmolgrid, are not compatible with Windows. It should be executed on a GPU-equipped machine.

The below libraries and their versions ensure the program functions without issues

``` pip install -r requirements.txt```

As a second option, Google Colab is a good choice if you want to use our program without needing a specific operating system or GPU on your local machine
